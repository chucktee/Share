#Chucks_GPS_2010.pde
This was built in 3 days before BurningMan 2010.  It's the code for my GPS camp finder with touchscreen interface anf GPS logging.  This is a working example of how I write code that I will probably be the only one viewing it.  Just enough to hopefully come back and figure out what I was doing.
